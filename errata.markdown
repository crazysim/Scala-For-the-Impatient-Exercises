There are some odd things with the exercises in the sample I got from Typesafe.
I wonder if they're still there in the one that's printed on dead plant matter
or sold as bits from online stores.

* CH 4 EX#2: I had to instantiate a File object to pass
  into the scanner.
* CH 5 EX#6: I don't see a Person class in section 5.1. What is he going on
  about?
